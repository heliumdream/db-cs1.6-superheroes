Found this superhero package maintained by ibiruai:
https://github.com/ibiruai/cstrike-superhero-server/tree/master/cstrike

It had a really cool cooldown implementation, that I expanded to included every hero with a relevant cooldown on my server. Putting it back out there for anyone else who might benefit from it. Enjoy!
PS: Sorry for the lack of explanation; if you've made it this far, I reckon you already know what to do with this stuff.
